# ICP_1_Spring24

This Python script (ICP_1_Spring24.py) contains various functions related to string manipulation, basic arithmetic operations, word replacement, and letter grading.

## Sections

### 1a - Process String
This section defines a function process_string that takes user input, randomly removes two characters, and outputs the reversed string without those characters.

### 1b - Arithmetic Operations
This part defines basic arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and takes user input to perform these operations on two numbers.

### 2 - Replace Word
This section defines a "replace_function" that replaces occurrences of a word (case-insensitive) in a given sentence with a replacement word. User input is used to demonstrate this functionality.

### 3 - Grading
This part defines a "get_letter_grade" function that assigns a letter grade based on a numerical score. User input is taken to get a class score, and the corresponding letter grade is displayed.
